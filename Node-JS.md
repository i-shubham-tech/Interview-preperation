## 1. Introduction

### 🧠 What is Node.js?
Node.js is an **open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment** that allows  to run JavaScript **outside the browser**, mainly on the **server side**.  
It built on  **Google Chrome V8 engine** to execute code at lightning speed and provides an single-thread, non-blocking event-driven architecture .

### ⚡ Why Node.js? (Advantages over Traditional Backend Tech)
- **Single Language:** Use JavaScript for both frontend and backend.  
- **High Performance:** Built on V8 engine boosts execution speed.
- **REST SAME AS FEATURE**

### 🌟 Features of Node.js

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Single Threaded** | Uses an event loop to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently without creating new threads for each. |
| **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking I/O** | Handles multiple operations(file read,db query) without waiting for any to finish by using callbacks, promises, or async/await. |
| **Event-Driven** | Uses an event loop that listens for events and executes corresponding callbacks. |
| **Rich npm Library** | Provides access to over a million reusable open-source packages. |
| **Cross-Platform Support** | Compatible with major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. |
| **Community Support** | Backed by a large and active open-source community contributing to continuous improvement. |

### 🌍 Where Node.js is Used (Real-World Use Cases)

| **Use Case** | **Description / Examples** |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| **Real-time Applications** | Ideal for chat apps, collaboration tools, and gaming servers (e.g., Socket.io, Slack). |
| **Streaming Services** | Used by platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Twitch for seamless video/audio streaming. |
| **API Development** | Commonly used for building RESTful and GraphQL APIs due to its lightweight and fast nature. |
| **Microservices Architecture** | Perfect for developing modular, scalable microservices-based backends. |
| **IoT Applications** | Handles multiple device connections efficiently using event-driven architecture. |
| **Serverless Computing** | Widely supported in cloud platforms like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. |
